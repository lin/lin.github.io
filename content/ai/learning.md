### The nature of teaching

For each information vector $v$, we have a list of transformation matrix $m_i$ with force weight $w_i$ as how hard it is to retrieve from the database, so that we can get new information vectors $u_i$.

For a known space, the educator has been trained with lots of data, so he/she knows the $v \rightarrow m_i$ beforehand, the task for he/she is to train a new learner this relationships in a short period of time.

We evaluate the learner by how well he/she solves a problemset to estimate the $v \rightarrow m_i$ model he/she acquired. And compare the learner's model to the ideal model to get a numerical skill-level.
