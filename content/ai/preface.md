## Preface

The necessity of Turing complete, but not its completeness.

To do all possible computations, we need freedoms that include a few for-all sentences. 

- The ability to distinguish (has boundary)
- The ability to recognize
- The ability to reproduce
- The ability to use internal representations
- Access its neighbors freely.
- Store information freely.

The ability to distinguish stuffs is the most fundamental ability for any intelligent agents.  

All it cares is that these two objects are different.

The second ability for the agent is to represent objects as in a composition, like an array or linked list.

- Any object
- Any transformation
- Any instruction
- Any composition

New abilities:
- We need an unlimited distinguishable symbol generator.
- We need an unlimited space to place any combination of symbols.
- We need to be able to carry out any transformation that takes any symbol to any symbol.
- We need to be able to carry out any sequence of transformations.

DistInguishability:

- All we care is they distinguished. Chess. Represent their distinguished states.
- At heart, computation is doing stuff on the abstract level
- Computation is the maximum freedom without Ambiguity.
- So the first is what is the maximum freedom, what set of first-order logic can be expressed to capture this level of freedom.
- The nature tends to be a single set of physical rules to follow. But as a programmer, they can define a huge amount of rules, they can simulate a world that time can be stopped.
- What we talk about here is this set of freedom. Human computer is quite flexible and able to adapt to different situations and environments. The tasks human computer can be done is quite versatile, of course so does the computer we are using.
- This freedom ends up with some limitations. 
- What bugs me is that I have to admit lots of premises. Those facts are the philosophical problems. Though I wish I can abstract something more general and make it smooth and clear and reasonable. But I couldn’t. Even I wish I could basically discuss it as engineeringly satisfiable. I can’t.
- Turing complete is a mystery.

The freedom of computation. The limitation of computation.

Any set is a class. Any reverse computation is a class.
