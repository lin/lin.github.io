Both Q4 from this week is at the boundary of my ability.

### Biweekly Contest 105 - Q4 - reached 917 / 921

[2709. Greatest Common Divisor Traversal](https://leetcode.com/contest/biweekly-contest-105/problems/greatest-common-divisor-traversal/)

I know this is DSU with primes for sure in the first minute. But I couldn't find it out using the same technique as in the sieve of Eratosthenes.

Actually I have solved similar problems before:

- [1862. Sum of Floored Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-floored-pairs/)
- [1819. Number of Different Subsequences GCDs](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-different-subsequences-gcds/)

Next time, when I see GCD problems, I will think about harmonic series first.

### Weekly Contest 347 - Q4 - reached 558 / 564 

Funny thing: Because I have to work on the tutoring project, I attended the contest using another account to avoid pollution, but competing while working performed better (1200 vs 2300) than the previous night even though I have to leave the contest to answer questions from students.

When I got a negtive delta,

1. Hacked and rejudged after contest for the first time, `-86`
1. And then I have 7 contests that I can't solve it fast enough.
1. Resubmit Q2 after the contest is near over, 
1. DFS is not working well for python, giving me `runtime error`
1. For several times, I can't solve DIV2C because of not trying brute force solutions.
1. Module while in loop, [C. Counting Orders](https://codeforces.com/contest/1828/problem/C)
