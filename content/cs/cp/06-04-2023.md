### The Week of Disasters

1. I solved Leetcode WC 348 Q3 in 5 mins after corrected my misunderstanding, I thought I have to sum up every query. Should be in top 1000.
1. So tired when solving CF 876, solving Q1 after 20+ minutes.
1. Doing pretty good at ABC 304, but that contest ends up unrated due to slow scoring.
1. I am getting negative delta at LC for three contests. Wish myself luck for next week!
1. I can't solve DIV2B for the very first time! (except for the rejudge and the second contest about input)
1. [B. Minimize Permutation Subarrays](https://codeforces.com/contest/1838/problem/B), I spent 115 minutes for this problem. And the solution is quite simple. It seems like if I don't realize the trick, I may solve this problem for another two hours. What a sad day!
