### Codechef Palindrome XOR

Attended Codechef after a day of hard work, unable to solve the first problem due to miscalculation.

I thought `O(Prime Number Count * N)` which I correctly estimated as `10**7` is TLE, so I rejected the idea.

### Codeforces DIV 3

This contest is basically Leetcode-like, sliding window and binary search. And I got my best performance here.
