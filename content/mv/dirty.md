## Kitsch and Cheating: Why Wealth and Power’s Success Is Not Always Glamorous

The Hidden Shadows of Wealth and Power
Success, wealth, and power are often wrapped in a glamorous aura, celebrated as the ultimate proof of competence and value. Yet behind this veneer lies a darker story. Throughout history, many fortunes were not built solely on innovation, effort, or virtue but on deception, exploitation, or outright violence. From ancient kings and emperors to modern tycoons, the narratives of glory often conceal the human cost beneath.

Historical Roots of Bloody Success
In ancient times, the founders of dynasties were frequently warriors who seized power not through diplomacy but through bloodshed. They conquered rivals, destroyed entire clans, and enslaved populations — yet history books elevate them as heroes and visionaries. This romanticized view of power sanitizes the brutality necessary to establish and maintain it. A founding emperor or king may be praised for unifying a region or bringing stability, but the cost in human lives, suffering, and cultural erasure is often ignored.

Cheating and Exploitation as a Path to Riches
Even outside of conquest, wealth has long been linked with manipulation. Land monopolies, slavery, unfair taxation, and political corruption were common tools of enrichment. Those who could twist rules in their favor thrived, while ordinary people bore the burden. Such tactics mirrored “kitsch” — a cheap, gaudy substitute for authentic value. The appearance of greatness was carefully crafted while the substance was hollow or harmful.

Modern Parallels: The Illusion of Meritocracy
In the modern world, these patterns persist under subtler guises. Corporations may exploit loopholes, manipulate consumer psychology, or lobby for regulations that favor them at the expense of the public. The spectacle of philanthropy, branding, and lifestyle marketing serves as a new form of kitsch, turning questionable origins of wealth into stories of genius, hustle, and benevolence. We celebrate billionaires while overlooking the systems they exploit.

Rethinking Our Definition of Success
If we only equate success with money and power, we risk admiring outcomes rather than the ethics of the process. True success should involve the creation of genuine value, fairness in competition, and respect for human dignity. Yet this is a high bar, and history shows how rare it has been. By being aware of the mechanisms of cheating, manipulation, and kitsch, we can develop a more critical lens for evaluating today’s “heroes” and resist the glorification of exploitative success.

Conclusion: A Call for Critical Admiration
Wealth and power will always attract admiration, but we must be clear-eyed about how they are achieved. The glamour of money and authority is often built on blood, deceit, or manipulation — especially in earlier times when survival depended on dominance. Recognizing this does not erase achievements but places them in a fuller moral context. True progress begins when we value ethical innovation over ruthless ambition and when we see beyond the kitsch to the human cost of cheating.

The Price of Appealing to the Masses
Even when the path to wealth or success appears clean and legal, it often involves embracing shallowness and vulgarity rather than depth or innovation. Mass markets reward what is accessible, familiar, and emotionally gratifying, not necessarily what is intellectually stimulating or ethically superior. In this sense, success frequently demands pandering to the lowest common denominator — designing products, entertainment, or politics that flatter existing tastes instead of challenging people to think, grow, or transcend. This “kitsch dynamic” creates wealth by offering comfort and spectacle rather than advancing society in truly meaningful ways.

Example: The Rise of Short Drama Platforms
A vivid illustration of this dynamic is the explosion of ultra-short online dramas that dominate mobile platforms today. These bite-sized soap-opera-style shows often rely on exaggerated plots, crude tropes, and shallow emotional triggers — revenge arcs, “rich CEO” fantasies, or melodramatic cliffhangers every 30 seconds. By almost any artistic standard, the production quality and writing depth are low. Yet they achieve staggering commercial success because they are engineered for maximum retention and easy emotional payoff. In other words, they embody “kitsch”: cheap to produce, instantly gratifying, and highly profitable. This mirrors the broader reality that being rich or successful often means leaning into the vulgar and formulaic, not creating works of lasting cultural or intellectual value
