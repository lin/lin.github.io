## 自由能原则

1. Reward / Utility / Score / Value
1. Surprise / Prediction Error / Chunkify

### Two Kinds of Predictin Errors

1. Pragmatic or Reward Prediction Error
1. Epistemic or Lexeme Prediction Error

But they are the same:

In reinforcement learning or decision theory, the complement of surprise is often called value (or utility).

Low surprise = high expected value (your predictions about the world are confirmed).

High surprise = low value (your model didn’t anticipate what happened).

So “optimizing a free-energy bound on surprise or its complement, value” means:

The brain works to keep its internal model of the world accurate and useful, by reducing prediction error (surprise). This can be phrased either as minimizing surprise (via the free energy bound) or equivalently as maximizing value (the utility of good predictions and actions).
