During the pandemic in 2021, I bought a second-hand Wii U online. It was cheap but came with one drawback: the entire interface was in Japanese. That frustration turned into motivation. Over the next five years, I studied Japanese on Duolingo. As a native Chinese speaker fluent in English, learning Japanese opened doors to ways of thinking and living that physics and computer science could never teach me.

## Camera in Japanese

In early 20th-century Japan, a camera was called **shashinki**—**寫眞機**. In Japanese, shashin (寫眞) means “photo,” and ki (機) means “machine,” so the compound literally meant “photo-machine.” Because the characters are the same, a Chinese speaker can also easily understand this meaning. Over time, however, the everyday word shifted to **kamera**—**カメラ**. Written out, the contrast is striking:

$$
\text{寫眞機} \longrightarrow \text{カメラ}
$$

Switching from dense kanji to three katakana characters slashed the stroke count, making the word much faster to write and easier to use—an ergonomic advantage that likely sped up adoption. But ease wasn’t the only factor. Katakana also signals foreign origin and modernity, and “camera” entered Japan along with Western technology, branding, and education. This combination of practicality and prestige helped **カメラ** displace **寫眞機** in everyday language.
