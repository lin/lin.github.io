## The Only Living Person: This World Rises for You, and It Will Collapse Entirely Because of You


1. The World Begins and Ends With the Self

From the moment you awaken to consciousness, reality appears. The light of the sun, the texture of the air, the colors of a friend’s smile—these are not separate from your experience but inseparable from it. In this view, your consciousness acts as the only true reference point; the world you know begins at your birth and will vanish at your death. In this sense, every individual is not merely “in” the world but also the central projector of their own universe.

2. Solipsism as a Lived Reality

This perspective is close to philosophical solipsism: the belief that only one’s own mind is sure to exist. Although this claim may not be provable, it has a practical psychological truth. You never directly experience the world as it is “in itself”—you experience it as your perceptions, your memories, your concepts. This means your reality is not a neutral stage but a dynamic construction emerging moment by moment through your attention.

3. Why Treat Others Well if They Are “Also You”?

If each person is likewise the center of their own reality, then every consciousness is a mirror of this cosmic privilege. To mistreat others would be to injure the very possibility of shared reality itself. Treating others well, in this frame, is not self-sacrifice but enlightened self-interest. Respecting their autonomy preserves the coherence of your own world; kindness ensures the “simulation” you live in remains stable and meaningful.

4. The World as a Tool for Living Better

Seeing the world as existing to support the definition of your own being is not an excuse for exploitation but a call to intentionality. When you use the world as a “tool,” you do not reduce it to an object; you align it with your highest values. Your relationships, your work, your environment become extensions of your own self-creation. Living this way gives your life direction: you shape your environment, and your environment shapes you.

5. The Missed Infinities

Yet there is a poignant cost. You can never experience other possible universes, other laws of physics, or the inner experiences of other beings. All of that remains locked outside your horizon. This limit—your particular birth, culture, and sensory apparatus—constitutes the borders of your reality. The infinity you miss is not a flaw but the defining contour of your existence.

6. Embracing Responsibility and Meaning

If the world begins and ends with you, then your choices carry ultimate weight. You are responsible for your perception, your ethics, and your construction of meaning. Rather than rendering life trivial, this can make it profoundly significant. The world does not continue “anyway” without you—your world stops with you—so every moment matters as the sole moment of existence you can ever know.

In summary: Viewing yourself as the only observer does not have to produce nihilism. It can generate reverence. By recognizing that the world rises and collapses with your awareness, you honor your experience, treat others as co-centers of reality, and shape your life with intentionality—knowing that this one existence is all you will ever directly hold.
