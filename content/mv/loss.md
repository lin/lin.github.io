If a 9/11-scale tragedy (≈3,000 deaths) happened every single day starting on September 1, 1939 — the day World War II began — it would continue, day after day, all the way until September 11, 2001.

In other words, the entire 62-year span between the start of WWII and the 9/11 attacks matches the scale of WWII’s estimated death toll of roughly 70 million people.

看过很多 911 的纪录片，事件发生时，我也有很深刻印象

知道死了很多人，造成了很深远的悲剧

也成为了我衡量伤亡人数的指标

911中丧生的人数，大约3000人，如果每天都有一起911，连续三年

死亡的人数是3百30万人，而这个数字在历史上并不常见

1. 饥荒
1. 战争
1. 瘟疫

3年911 的这个数量

利用911这个事件，一个是比较近，大家有切身的震撼，也是这个事报道的多，了解的多

On September 11, 2001, about 3,000 people died in a matter of hours. This number is widely known, heavily reported, and emotionally vivid. By defining one “9/11 unit” as approximately 3,000 sudden deaths, we can translate abstract figures into something people feel. For example, saying “the conflict killed 30,000 civilians” may elicit an abstract nod, but saying “the conflict killed the equivalent of ten 9/11s” jolts the imagination. The latter links statistics to a shared emotional template.

A single shocking event like 9/11 creates a dense, well-modeled memory: the images, the stories, the faces. When we compare other events to it, we piggyback on that already-formed model, reducing cognitive effort.

Holodomor Famine (Ukraine, 1932–33)
~3.5 million
1,166
One 9/11 every day for 3 years

World War II Total Deaths
~70 million
23,333
One 9/11 every day for 64 years

## The Idea: 911-Units

* **Definition**: One “911-Unit” = \~3,000 sudden deaths (the approximate toll of 9/11).
* **Conversion**:

  * 10,000 deaths ≈ 3.3 “911-Units”
  * 100,000 deaths ≈ 33 “911-Units”
  * 1,000,000 deaths ≈ 333 “911-Units”

This lets you *translate statistics into felt scale*. Instead of saying “10 million died in the famine,” you can say “it was over **3,000 times a 9/11**.”

## Why This Works

1. **Psychological salience**: 9/11 was widely covered, emotionally vivid, and many alive today remember where they were. That memory anchors the scale.
2. **Narrative stickiness**: Big numbers blur. But “100 times 9/11” sticks, because it links abstract data to an embodied memory.
3. **Comparability**: Works across contexts — famine, pandemic, war — without losing the raw human weight.

## Historical Comparisons in 911-Units

* **COVID-19 (global, \~7 million reported deaths)**
  ≈ 2,333 “911-Units.”
  Equivalent to one 9/11 happening *every day for more than six years*.
* **Holodomor famine (Ukraine, 1932–33, \~3.5 million deaths)**
  ≈ 1,166 “911-Units.”
  Equivalent to a 9/11 *every single day for three years*.
* **World War II (civilian + military deaths \~70 million)**
  ≈ 23,333 “911-Units.”
  Equivalent to 9/11 repeating *every day for 64 years*.

## Variations of the Metric

* **Daily 9/11s**: Instead of units, speak in *frequency*. Example: “The Bengal famine killed at a rate of one 9/11 every two days.”
* **Cascading 9/11s**: For sustained tragedies, describe them as chains: “The Syrian civil war has been a rolling sequence of 9/11s, one every week for over a decade.”

---

## Caveats

* This metric works best for sudden, violent, or preventable deaths. It may not map neatly onto slow or non-lethal harms (e.g. displacement, chronic disease).
* It risks sensationalism, so it should be used thoughtfully — as a bridge to empathy, not as shock-value.

✨ In short: a **“911-Unit” metric** gives people a visceral way to grasp the incomprehensible scales of tragedy. It translates cold numbers into something anchored in shared cultural memory.
