The Luck Factor — Why We Shouldn’t Deify Successful People

Introduction: Success and Its Halo Effect
Modern culture tends to glorify those who achieve extraordinary success — founders of tech giants, athletes at the top of their sport, or celebrities whose careers skyrocket seemingly overnight. Books and articles dissect their routines, habits, and “mindsets,” treating them as living formulas for greatness. Yet this obsession with the so-called “secrets of success” often hides one of the most powerful forces at play: luck. When we deify successful people, we risk misunderstanding the role of randomness, timing, and social context in shaping outcomes.

The Mirage of Merit Alone
It is tempting to attribute success entirely to talent, hard work, and strategic thinking. These factors are undeniably important. However, decades of research in behavioral economics and sociology show that equally skilled and hardworking people often experience vastly different outcomes depending on circumstances beyond their control: being born in the right decade, meeting the right mentor, living in the right city, or even stumbling upon an idea at the right historical moment. Ignoring this randomness creates a myth of perfect meritocracy that misleads both aspiring individuals and policymakers.

Luck’s Compounding Effect
Luck is not only about a single event; it compounds. Small advantages early in life — better schools, healthier environments, family networks, or simple geographic luck — can snowball over time into outsized achievements. This “Matthew Effect” (the rich get richer) means that even a slight edge can grow into a dominant position decades later. When we deify successful people without acknowledging their starting advantages, we turn these cumulative accidents into evidence of innate superiority.

The Survivorship Bias Problem
Our focus on winners ignores the many equally capable individuals who tried and failed. For every world-famous entrepreneur, there are hundreds who pursued similar ideas with similar skill but were not in the right place at the right time. This is called survivorship bias: the error of studying only the visible survivors and mistaking their success for a universal blueprint. By deifying the winners, we blind ourselves to the randomness that shapes outcomes and perpetuate myths of “failproof” strategies.

Why This Matters for Society
Deifying successful people can harm both individuals and society. At the personal level, it creates unrealistic expectations, shame, and burnout among those who don’t reach similar heights. At the systemic level, it can justify inequality: if success is seen as purely meritocratic, then the wealthy must “deserve” their wealth and the poor must “deserve” their hardship. Recognizing luck’s role creates space for humility, empathy, and fairer systems that provide more opportunities for everyone.

A Healthier Way to View Success
A more balanced approach is to admire skills, discipline, and resilience without assuming these alone guarantee results. We can still learn from successful people — their strategies, mindsets, and methods — but we should place these lessons within the broader context of chance, social networks, and historical timing. Celebrating persistence and creativity while acknowledging luck leads to a more grounded, less myth-driven culture of aspiration.

Conclusion: Humility in the Face of Chance
The point is not to diminish the effort of successful individuals but to paint a more honest picture. Recognizing the luck factor brings humility to the winners and compassion to the rest. It also helps us design better policies, reduce harmful myths, and encourage a healthier pursuit of goals. Instead of deifying successful people, we can appreciate their achievements while keeping our eyes open to the invisible hand of chance that shapes all human lives.
