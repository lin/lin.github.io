## Inclusion and Welfare: Most People Should See Themselves as Part of the Majority

Escaping the Elite Illusion
Many modern societies are built around the promise of upward mobility. Advertisements, social media, and corporate culture all suggest that with enough hard work and cleverness, anyone can become an elite—a CEO, a top performer, or a “little king” who controls resources. Yet mathematically, this cannot be true for everyone. By definition, elites are few. If most people orient their choices, politics, and social policies around the fantasy of becoming an elite, the resulting system will fail the majority. This is why embracing inclusion and welfare—seeing oneself as part of the majority—is essential for a healthy, stable society.

The Myth of Universal Upward Mobility
The “rags to riches” story has powerful emotional appeal. It frames society as fair and meritocratic, implying that those at the top earned their position. However, empirical reality shows that only a small fraction of people reach the upper tiers of wealth and power, and structural barriers—education, family background, discrimination—further reduce the odds. Designing policies under the assumption that you personally will “make it” biases public policy toward protecting the few at the top rather than uplifting the many at the middle and bottom.

Master–Servant Thinking and Its Consequences
When individuals believe they are future elites, they may unconsciously adopt a master–servant worldview. They vote against redistribution, oppose public welfare, and tolerate precarious working conditions because they assume they will one day benefit from the very hierarchy that currently oppresses them. This mindset creates fragile social contracts and undermines solidarity, making societies more unequal and more brittle.

The Case for Majority-Centered Systems
A more realistic—and more humane—approach is to accept that most people will live ordinary lives, and that ordinary lives deserve dignity, security, and opportunity. This does not mean suppressing ambition or excellence; rather, it means designing systems that work for the median citizen, not just the exceptional one. Examples include universal healthcare, accessible education, affordable housing, and robust labor protections. These systems acknowledge that well-being for the many is not a by-product of success at the top but a foundation for a healthy society.

Psychological Freedom in Accepting the Majority Self
Recognizing oneself as part of the majority can also liberate individuals psychologically. It reduces the shame of not becoming “special,” diminishes status anxiety, and fosters empathy. People become more willing to support collective goods and long-term investments rather than chasing zero-sum competition. Ironically, this can lead to a more innovative and prosperous society because people feel secure enough to take risks without fear of total ruin.

Conclusion – Building a Society for the Many, Not the Few
The idea that “most people should see themselves as part of the majority” is not an attack on ambition—it is an invitation to realism and solidarity. By rejecting the elite fantasy and acknowledging our shared stake in inclusive welfare, societies can escape the master–servant trap and create institutions that genuinely benefit everyone. In the long run, this majority-centered perspective produces not only more fairness but also more stability, trust, and collective prosperity.

Example – Ivy League Dreams vs. Building Value in Ordinary Universities

Not everyone can attend an Ivy League school. The number of seats is tiny relative to the global population of college-aged students, and admissions are fiercely competitive. Yet in many societies, families invest huge sums of money, endless tutoring hours, and emotional energy to push their children toward these elite institutions. This creates an arms race of credentials but does little to improve the life chances of the vast majority who will attend non-elite schools.

A more realistic and socially beneficial approach is to strengthen normal universities and colleges so that their graduates have clear pathways to good jobs, civic participation, and upward mobility. Rather than pouring disproportionate resources into elite admissions prep, governments and communities could channel investment into high-quality teaching, modern labs, internships, and partnerships with employers at public or regional institutions. This raises the baseline of opportunity for most students instead of concentrating it at the top.

Of course, Ivy League and other elite schools will continue to exist, but we should not treat them as the default model of success. They could be asked to share research, open online courses, or collaborate with public universities so that their prestige benefits more people indirectly. However, it is unrealistic—and unfair—to expect that every child can or should attend an Ivy League. Accepting this reality frees us to design a system where the majority receive meaningful education and work opportunities without having to win an elite lottery.
