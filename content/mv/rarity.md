## Rarity

Rarity is a fundamental concept that permeates various aspects of our understanding of the world. Whether applied to intellectual abilities, wealth, or natural phenomena, rarity denotes something that is uncommon or infrequent within a given context. While recognizing rarity can provide valuable insights into the diversity and distribution of traits and resources, it also carries potential pitfalls, particularly when rarity is misconstrued as a measure of worth or goodness. This essay explores the significance of rarity in comprehending the world, highlighting both its utility and the misconceptions that can arise from its misinterpretation.

At its core, rarity is a statistical measure indicating how uncommon a particular attribute or occurrence is within a population. For instance, IQ is often cited as a rare trait, with high IQ scores appearing infrequently in the general population. However, IQ as a measure of cognitive ability has its limitations. While it reflects certain intellectual capacities, it does not capture the full spectrum of human cognition, creativity, emotional intelligence, or practical skills. The distribution of IQ scores illustrates the natural variation in cognitive abilities, emphasizing that rarity in one aspect does not equate to overall superiority or utility.

Rarity becomes particularly salient when examining societal perceptions and values. Humans have a tendency to equate rarity with excellence or desirability, a cognitive bias that can distort our understanding of what is truly valuable. For example, consider Bill Gates, who was the world's richest person for many years. His wealth is a rare occurrence, but this rarity stems more from his involvement in the highly valued software industry rather than from exceptional cognitive abilities. Gates’ success is a product of industry dynamics, market forces, and innovation, rather than sheer intellectual rarity. In cognitive terms, he may not be significantly rarer than many other entrepreneurs who run smaller companies, highlighting that rarity in one domain does not necessarily translate to rarity in another.

This misconception extends to other areas as well. In fields like art or sports, rare talents are often lionized, sometimes overlooking the broader context of hard work, opportunity, and support systems that contribute to success. Similarly, rare natural phenomena, such as certain species or geological formations, are valued for their uniqueness, which can lead to both conservation efforts and commercialization that may not always align with ecological or ethical considerations.

The pitfalls of equating rarity with goodness or value are multifaceted. Firstly, it can lead to the undervaluing of common but essential traits and resources. For instance, average cognitive abilities are the norm and form the backbone of societal functioning, yet they may be overlooked in favor of celebrating exceptionalism. Secondly, this bias can foster elitism and exclusion, where individuals or groups are privileged based on their rarity rather than their actual contributions or intrinsic worth. Lastly, it can result in misallocation of resources, where rare attributes are overemphasized at the expense of addressing more prevalent and pressing issues.

Understanding rarity's role in the world requires a balanced perspective that recognizes both its importance and its limitations. Rarity can illuminate the diversity and complexity of the world, highlighting unique attributes and phenomena that contribute to the richness of human experience and natural environments. However, it is crucial to avoid conflating rarity with inherent value or goodness. By appreciating rarity within its proper context, we can foster a more nuanced and equitable understanding of the world, recognizing that both rare and common elements hold significance in their own right.

In conclusion, rarity is a powerful concept that aids in understanding the distribution and diversity of traits and phenomena in the world. While it offers valuable insights, it is essential to approach rarity with critical awareness to prevent the misinterpretation that rarity equates to superiority or value. By doing so, we can appreciate the true complexity of the world, valuing both the rare and the common for their unique contributions to the tapestry of human and natural existence.

## Stop Bingeing on the News: Protect Your Mind from Lexeme Overload

In a world where every headline competes for our attention, we’ve normalized consuming a daily torrent of news — but most of it does little to improve our lives. The modern news cycle thrives on extremes: crimes, disasters, scandals, and rare events that are amplified precisely because they’re unusual. By reading too much news, you’re not getting a clearer picture of reality; you’re training your mind to overestimate the extraordinary and underestimate the ordinary.

The Extremity Bias

News organizations rarely lead with “everything is normal today.” Instead, they highlight the bizarre and the catastrophic because that’s what draws clicks and ads. Over time, your mental model of the world skews toward danger and volatility. This extremity bias isn’t just a nuisance — it makes you anxious, more reactive, and less capable of clear thinking in everyday life.

Lexeme Overload and Cognitive Junk Food

Every news article introduces new words, names, and ideas — what you might call lexemes. But most of these lexemes are short-lived: names of transient scandals, one-off policy debates, or celebrity controversies. They clutter your mental storage without creating deep understanding. Just as junk food overloads your calories without nutrition, junk news overloads your vocabulary without wisdom.

The Illusion of Knowledge

Reading endless snippets can create a false sense of being “informed.” In reality, most news is fake knowledge — not because it’s deliberately false, but because it’s irrelevant or non-actionable. Knowing the names of five politicians from a faraway scandal won’t help you build better habits, strengthen your relationships, or improve your skills. It’s like memorizing random lottery numbers: effortful but useless.

A Healthier Alternative

Instead of grazing on endless headlines, invest your attention in slow, structured learning: books, long-form essays, or skill development. These sources give you context, depth, and frameworks — not just a flash of outrage or novelty. By curating your information diet, you preserve mental bandwidth for knowledge that actually compounds over time.
