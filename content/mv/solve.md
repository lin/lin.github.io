## Creating Wealth is Solving Problems

In today's world, people hold various common beliefs about money and wealth creation. Many see money as something to be earned through hard work, inherited, or accumulated through investments. Some believe wealth comes primarily from owning assets, playing the stock market, or climbing the corporate ladder. Others view it as a finite resource to be competed for, where one person's gain must be another's loss. These perspectives, while containing elements of truth, miss a deeper fundamental principle about how new wealth is actually created in society. When we look beyond money as just currency or numbers in accounts, we can see that real wealth creation follows a remarkably simple principle: it comes from solving problems for others.

This ranges from everyday solutions (like convenience stores solving our midnight snack cravings, mechanics fixing our broken cars, or hairdressers styling our hair) to professional services (like doctors treating illnesses, lawyers handling legal issues, or teachers educating our children) all the way up to groundbreaking innovations (like scientists developing new medicines, engineers building rockets for space exploration, or researchers advancing artificial intelligence). Each solution creates value by making someone's life better or easier, and this value creation is the true essence of wealth generation.

Consider a person stranded alone on an isolated island—perhaps the purest example of problem-solving economics at work. Each day presents a cascade of survival challenges: finding fresh water, securing food, creating shelter, and maintaining health. Their "wealth" is measured not in currency but in solutions: a crafted water collection system from palm leaves, a fishing spear fashioned from bamboo, a shelter built from local materials, or medicinal knowledge about island plants. Each solution they devise directly improves their quality of life and represents a form of wealth creation, even without the presence of markets or money. If another person arrived on the island, our survivor could teach them these survival solutions or trade their crafted tools—effectively transferring their problem-solving wealth to another. This mirrors our modern economy: when we solve problems for others, we're essentially trading our solutions (wealth) for their resources (usually money), creating a mutually beneficial exchange of value. This fundamental connection between problem-solving and wealth creation exists whether we're alone on an island or operating in a complex global economy.

When we exchange services with others, we are essentially trading our human computational power—our ability to process information, solve problems, and execute solutions. Just as a computer has both hardware (its physical processing capabilities) and software (its programmed knowledge and algorithms), humans offer both physical capabilities and mental expertise. When a doctor diagnoses an illness, they're running complex pattern-recognition algorithms in their mind. When an architect designs a building, they're processing vast amounts of variables through their mental computing power. When a teacher explains a concept, they're executing a sophisticated information transfer protocol. In this light, every service transaction is really an exchange of human computational resources, where we sell our ability to solve specific types of problems. The wealth we receive in return is compensation for lending out our natural problem-solving capabilities—our human hardware and software—to benefit others.

The greatest leverage in problem-solving comes from creating generic, reusable solutions that can address similar problems across different contexts. Think of a popular song: the musicians solve the problem of entertainment once, but can sell this solution millions of times through recordings. Software developers write code once but can distribute it globally at virtually no cost. A well-designed production line becomes a template that can be replicated across factories worldwide. These generic solutions act as intellectual assets that generate wealth each time they're deployed, without requiring the original problem-solver to be directly involved. This "solve once, sell many times" approach transforms the economics of problem-solving from a one-to-one service exchange into a one-to-many value multiplication. It's why creators of scalable solutions—whether they're artists, inventors, or entrepreneurs—can potentially generate extraordinary wealth compared to those who solve problems on a case-by-case basis.

At its core, every successful business transaction represents a solution to someone's problem. When you purchase a bottle of water, you're solving the problem of thirst. When you hire a lawyer, you're addressing the complex problem of legal compliance or dispute resolution. When you buy a smartphone, you're solving multiple problems related to communication, entertainment, and productivity. The more pressing or significant the problem, the more value people place on its solution.

The correlation between problem difficulty and financial reward is particularly telling. Complex problems that few can solve naturally command higher compensation. Consider the development of breakthrough medications: pharmaceutical companies invest billions in research and development because solving critical health problems generates substantial returns. Similarly, innovative technology companies that tackle challenging computing problems often see astronomical valuations because their solutions impact millions of users globally.

The magnitude of wealth someone can command for a solution - and thus the wealth they can generate - follows a fundamental economic principle: it rises with both the scarcity of the solution and the intensity of demand for it. When a solution is abundant and easily accessible, its price remains low regardless of its usefulness, as people can easily find alternatives. For instance, basic word processing software, despite its utility, commands little premium today because numerous free alternatives exist. Conversely, when a solution is rare - whether due to difficulty in creating it, complexity in delivering it, or simply its limited availability - its potential value increases. Consider specialized medical procedures that only a handful of surgeons can perform, or cutting-edge AI models that few companies have the capability to develop.

These two factors - solution scarcity and demand intensity - work as multipliers on each other. A rare solution to a problem few people care about generates little wealth, like a masterfully crafted solution to an obscure mathematical puzzle. Similarly, an easily available solution, no matter how desperately wanted, quickly becomes commoditized as supply rises to meet demand, as seen with simple face masks during normal times. The greatest wealth-creation opportunities emerge when genuine scarcity intersects with intense demand: when something that's difficult to provide solves a problem that many people urgently need addressed. This explains the success of breakthrough medications for common diseases, or why property in prime urban locations commands such high prices - both combine high demand with inherent scarcity. This fundamental dynamic underlies all value creation, from the simplest transactions to the most complex innovations.

The interaction between these factors explains the extraordinary success of many modern enterprises. Microsoft's early dominance came from combining rare capabilities (the ability to create user-friendly operating systems) with something people strongly desired: a personal computer that anyone could understand and use. Google achieved similar dynamics by developing rare expertise in information organization and search, creating such an elegant way to access knowledge that it became the preferred choice for billions of people. Amazon built hard-to-replicate logistics and digital infrastructure that gave people a fundamentally better way to shop, transforming their expectations through convenience, choice, and reliability. In each case, these companies created exceptional value by pairing hard-to-replicate solutions with experiences that people found deeply appealing and satisfying.

However, this framework also explains why certain ventures fail despite seeming promising on paper. Products or services that don't address real problems—or address them inadequately—struggle regardless of marketing or funding. Conversely, simple solutions to widespread problems can become remarkably successful, as demonstrated by products like the zipper or the paper clip.

The implication for entrepreneurs and business leaders is clear: focus on identifying and solving meaningful problems rather than just chasing profit. The most reliable path to financial success lies in creating genuine value for others. This might mean developing new technologies, improving existing services, or finding innovative ways to deliver solutions to more people more efficiently.

Moreover, this understanding reframes the very nature of business opportunity. Instead of viewing market gaps as mere chances for profit, they can be seen as indicators of unsolved problems or unmet needs. This perspective not only leads to more sustainable business models but also aligns profit-seeking with social benefit.

This framework of solution rarity and genuine desire also helps us identify the darkest forms of wealth extraction that occur without value creation. Throughout history, conquerors and colonizers accumulated massive wealth not by solving problems, but by enslaving populations and stealing their resources. In modern times, sophisticated con artists and fraudsters build Ponzi schemes that generate no real value, instead creating elaborate illusions to extract wealth from victims. Corporate raiders may strip companies of their assets and destroy jobs while enriching themselves. Even some legitimate-appearing businesses may function more like parasites than problem-solvers, using deceptive practices or manipulative tactics to extract wealth while providing little or no real benefit to society. By understanding that true wealth creation comes from combining genuine solution rarity with strong desire, we can better distinguish between those who generate new value for society and those who prey upon it for personal gain.

This understanding of wealth as accumulated problem-solving value gives us a powerful tool to identify unsustainable bubbles and scams. Consider a Ponzi scheme: while it appears to generate wealth for its participants, it solves no actual problems and creates no real value. The apparent wealth it generates must therefore come from somewhere else - in this case, from new participants' existing wealth. This pattern of wealth without underlying problem-solving appears in many forms: speculative bubbles where assets are traded at prices far beyond their problem-solving value, pyramid schemes that create elaborate facades of business activity without real solutions, or crypto tokens that claim to revolutionize finance while serving no practical purpose. When we see claims of wealth creation but cannot identify the corresponding problems being solved, we should be deeply skeptical. Real wealth cannot be created from nothing - it must be built on a foundation of actual solutions to real problems that people value.

## Living is Solving

Life, by its very nature, unfolds as a continuous stream of challenges—large and small, immediate and long-term—that demand our attention, ingenuity, and resilience. From the moment we wake up until the moment we rest our heads at night, we are confronted with situations that require us to analyze circumstances, understand constraints, and formulate solutions. While it may feel mundane to consider the act of preparing breakfast or navigating to work as a problem-solving exercise, the reality is that everyday tasks do, in fact, represent a vast constellation of challenges. How we address these challenges both reflects and refines our innate cognitive abilities. Moreover, our collective capacity to recognize patterns, identify solutions, and adapt to ever-more complex demands is the very foundation of human progress throughout history.

A seemingly simple activity—such as planning a meal—quickly reveals its problem-solving nature when looked at closely. We must decide what ingredients are available, determine how to prepare them, estimate cooking times, and ensure that the final result satisfies our hunger as well as our taste preferences. Similarly, commuting to work requires us to select a route, navigate traffic, and manage unexpected delays. Even the act of communicating with friends or colleagues involves deciding how best to phrase our thoughts to convey meaning efficiently and sensitively. In essence, each day is peppered with these “micro-problems,” and their solutions are not always obvious. Yet, we often solve them so fluidly that it is easy to forget they are challenges at all. These daily achievements, however minor they may seem, serve as the building blocks of our self-efficacy and confidence in tackling greater trials.

At a broader level, personal goals—such as improving one’s fitness, saving money, or learning a new language—are simply more complex sets of problems that require sustained attention and strategy. How does one balance work and exercise? Which expenses can be reduced to save more effectively? What study techniques will best facilitate language retention? Each question is a puzzle to be solved, and by engaging with them consistently, we sharpen our problem-solving toolkit. Over time, this constant negotiation of challenges shapes our intellect and character. The cumulative effect of countless small solutions prepares us for the inevitable larger problems that life will present: career crossroads, family dilemmas, and existential questions about meaning and purpose

While individual lives are shaped by problem-solving, the grand narrative of human civilization is defined by it. Our ancestors developed rudimentary tools, learned to control fire, and devised methods of agriculture not simply by trial and error alone, but by observing patterns—of seasons, animal behaviors, and materials—and employing cognitive strategies to bend those patterns to human advantage. Pattern recognition is at the core of how we learn, from deciphering language as children to understanding complex scientific principles as adults. It is the skill that enables us to generalize from past experiences, anticipate future outcomes, and create frameworks that can solve entirely new classes of problems.

Human history is marked by great leaps in collective problem-solving ability. The development of mathematics and the scientific method gave us structured ways to identify and solve problems, transforming guesswork into rigorous analysis. Over centuries, we built intricate social, political, and economic institutions—governments, trade networks, educational systems—that helped manage the complexities of human societies. The Industrial Revolution represented a systematic solution to increasing production demands, while modern computing and artificial intelligence emerge as powerful tools to process vast amounts of data, uncover subtle patterns, and propose innovative solutions.

The progression of history can, in large part, be understood as an ongoing narrative of humans confronting the unknown, devising answers, and thereby expanding the boundaries of possibility. The cultural achievements that define eras—the engineering marvels of the ancient world, the navigational breakthroughs of the Age of Exploration, the technological wonders of the Digital Age—all originate from the human drive to solve complex problems. These achievements, in turn, spawn new challenges. The cycle is never-ending. Each solution lays the groundwork for the next set of problems, often more intricate and abstract than those that came before.

To live is to engage fully with the myriad problems life places before us, both personal and collective. It can be easy to overlook this truth when the problems seem trivial or when their solutions become routines woven into the fabric of daily life. But recognizing this foundational aspect of the human experience can bring greater appreciation for both the mundane and the extraordinary challenges we face. When we learn to value problem-solving skills—creativity, critical thinking, adaptability—we are better equipped to navigate life’s uncertainties and to appreciate the historical lineage of thought and innovation that brought us here.

In acknowledging that living itself is essentially the art of tackling an endless series of problems, we come to see ourselves as active participants in a grand, ongoing story. With each problem solved, we not only improve our immediate circumstances but also add another small thread to the tapestry of human accomplishment. The cognitive abilities that allow us to spot patterns, to decode complexity, and to invent solutions are not just tools for surviving and thriving; they are the engines that power cultural evolution and historical progress. In this way, the very act of living—attending to everyday dilemmas, refining our pattern recognition skills, and applying them to increasingly complex challenges—is deeply intertwined with the human journey across time.
