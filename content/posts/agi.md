> New/Entropy, Useful/Utility, Fun/Attention, Explore/Mining

## PP

1. signal arousing lexemes
1. aroused lexemes will affect next prediction
1. if brain pay more attention, the precision will go up.
1. brain don't have habits to consider important things more carefully
1. change perspective (word connections) can lead to dramatic error reduction.
1. analogy exposure / lightup
1. novelty learning / update existing (wrong ideas talk 1000 times)
1. information loss gives you classes, 
1. itch of creating a new lexeme

## Nature

Distinguish

Association

Composition

Transformation

词汇就是连接

抽象也是词汇

## Repetition

It tells you not only what information means but also what information is valuable.

## Information Rich

> Reduce the entropy to predict next token in a certain context.

High Rate of Entropy Drop

Compresion / Invariant

Variance drop quickly

## High Utility

Useful in cared challenges.

## High Satisfaction in Desire

Attention magnet.

## 智力要素（文章版）

1. 训练量少，找到特征
2. 多个抽象层级的保存，一个 data，分解成多个信号
3. 不同的精准程度的搜索
4. attention is all you have，如何游戏化，fun，训练过程自己移动 attention
