## Pokémon

<img src='../img/game/pokemon.svg' height='600'>

In the image above and the following images:

1. The arrow means one thing is benefiting from another thing, maybe in generating more or maybe in generating more efficiently.
1. The rectangle means collectable or completable items. Most of time completing a task is a desirable thing. Sometimes meeting items that is rare to encounter can be a sur-prize which triggers dopamine. Most items can be used to decrease the difficulty in solving a problem, often obtained by users after completing a task.
1. The circle means repeatable problem sets. The set can be map-level, room-level, enermy-level, skill-level (图、室、敌、技).
1. The diamond means accumalatable currency, that can be exchanged to usable things that can satisfy curiosity / increasing efficiency / buy high rarity stuffs.
1. The colored one means by doing or obtaining itself is sufficient enough to be desirable. By linking with colored ones, the transparent background shapes become desirable as proxies to desired ones.

We use the *Pokémon Red and Green* as an example.

1. The main path of walkthrough can be somehow linear. And not too many people replay the game for multiple times as in a roguelike game. And this path is the main progression the player cares as people consider beat the game as an achievement.
1. Also along the way, completing the gym challenges to collect the badges are also rewarding.
1. By beating the enermies, the player is rewarded by coins and xp. By themselves, these accumulated fake currency is not intrinsically desirable. It has to be a proxy to something that is desirable. 
1. The coins can be used to buy items, which will benefit in solving the problems without much cognitive load. This is like using a cheatsheet to lookup the words. And similar to fast progress in cheating to get a certificate. If the items in the game are visually appealing like the pokemons, they can be themselves desirable, but normally in life the items are like medicine pills, useful but not directly appealing as in restaurant foods. 
1. The characters in Pokemon are cute, imagining catching those monsters itself is already rewarding. And then we find out that the monsters can be useful in solving the problems we care, it becomes more desirable, like an Apple Macbook Air.

## Super Mario Bros.

The pokemon is a typical RPG game where Mario is an action game.

1. The first thing is that in Mario you can't use coins or XPs to buy things to improve your ability in your future challegens. Only RPG-like stuff is that you can enter a new level with a super mario with an extra life, but it still like part of challenge instead of cheating.
1. But the coins is not useless, it can give you extra life if you gather every 100 coins. That extra life give you more chance to progress more in path.
1. Another benefit is that people want to compete with who has a higher score in one run.
1. Unlike pokemon, the original super mario bros. often is played multiple times for most users as it is hard to progress too much and you have to start it over. So this game can be consider a Rogue-like game, only the levels is not changing much.
1. Also unlike pokemon, your skills can be improve quickly by playing more mario, as in pokemon the improvement is more from levelup and better skill, there are less thing to master for normal players. This feature make mario more ACG.

## Duolingo

<img src='../img/game/duolingo.svg' height='500'>

Duolingo has game elements that seemingly borrowed from Candy Crush which was a phenomenal game at the launch of duolingo. And those tile-matching mobile games have similar features shared with Duolingo.

1. Unlike in other games, the lexemes or tasks for the user to remember and master is often useless in real world. But in an education gamified app, this is a key motivation.
1. Even though you can buy hearts to benefit your problem solving, which is like cheating in an exam, but this is a learning app not a testing app, mistakes should not be too punishing. But using hearts or energy, Duolingo can make this is a way to let serious users pay for a full game. So this feature is not a designed cheating as in an RPG.
1. Duolingo's main motivational forces are people's desire to master a new skill. Its XP system is not so strong as it leads to highscores in leaderboard and unappealing quests daily. As we see in most console games, those are not major drives to motivate users and well game designed.
