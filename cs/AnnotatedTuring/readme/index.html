In the paper, Turing proposed a machine which he argued is capable to do whatever a human computer could do.
And this machine has some limitations. Notably no machine can determine whether a given machine ever prints a zero or not.
But in first order logic (FOL), we don’t have the limitation to construct such a formula (whether a machine ever prints a zero).

<p>In the paper, Turing proposed a machine which he argued is capable to do whatever a human computer could do.</p>
<p>And this machine has some limitations. Notably no machine can determine whether a given machine ever prints a zero or not.</p>
<p>But in first order logic (FOL), we don&rsquo;t have the limitation to construct such a formula (whether a machine ever prints a zero).</p>
<p>Then main argument goes:</p>
<p>If we have a powerful mechanical procedure to determine whether a FOL is provable or not, we will encounter a FOL formula that describes the limitation of all mechanical prodedures.</p>
<p>That also means FOL is more expressive than mechanical procedures. It describes rather than solves.</p>
<p>FOL can describe this machine, as well as the properties of this machine. But some properties that are generically definable (also true specifically) are not computable.</p>
<p>The limitation or the constrait is basically the definable space is larger than the computable space. Hence the two different infinities.</p>

<p>An analogy:</p>
<p>Hilbert: Can we design a machine that solves every problems written in Chinese under seven characters?</p>
<p>Turing: All machine doesn&rsquo;t have the solution to how to live forever.</p>
<p>Turing: No machine can answer to the input: &ldquo;如何长生不老？&rdquo; (simply translate &ldquo;how to live forever&rdquo; to Chinese).</p>
<p>Turing: So we can&rsquo;t design a machine that solves every problems written in Chinese under seven characters?</p>
<p>Turing: The set of all problems written in Chinese under seven characters is a SUPER SUPER HUGE set.</p>
<p>Turing: It will be easy to find a problem no machine can answer but can be express under seven characters in Chinese.</p>
