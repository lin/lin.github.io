Not only a single bit of data, but a sequence of bits can be saved and accessed using flip flop techniques.</p><p>To make computer Turing Complete, jump is needed. That&rsquo;s what program counter does. Program counter can be made using combinatory logic and store/write data using flip-flop based register.</p><p>The ALU is to compute combinatory logic (with helper funcitons like add, inc, multi, xor, shift etc.), and CPU is for reading / writing data (DFF), calling ALU (NAND)to compute and controling (NAND & DFF) commands.</p><p>To access the memory, we need a register to store the address of memory (Memory Register).</p><p>To distinguish one command from another, we need a register to access the command address (Instruction Register).</p><p>Other registers are used to save temporary information, notably A (often accumulation is stored in A) register and B register for ALU, and D register for saving intermedia data. Others might saved on a short stack (local), memory(long) or files.</p></div><div class=tags></div></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>2025 Â© Copyright Yingkui.com All Rights Reserved</div></nav></div></body></html>
