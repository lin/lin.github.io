I didn’t notice this before David’s project.
Randomness is a form of art, a very different form from the predicted patterns.
When I was a child, I was fascinated by simple symbols, like Yin Yang Symbol:
Yin_yang_from_a_golden_spiral
I find beauty in this elegant and kind of mathematical object, it shows harmony and exactness.
Like Einstein, I believed that the nature of nature lies in “God doesn’t play with dice.” But Alberts are both wrong."><meta itemprop=datePublished content="2012-12-31T00:00:00+00:00"><meta itemprop=dateModified content="2012-12-31T00:00:00+00:00"><meta itemprop=wordCount content="485"><meta property="og:url" content="https://yingkui.com/ddf/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Yingkui Lin"><meta property="og:title" content="Digital Design Foundations 2012"><meta property="og:description" content="Functional Random https://ddfblog2012.wordpress.com/2012/12/29/functional-random/

But if there are hundreds of circles, I should arrange it properly.</p><p>This effect can be seen in the behavior of electrons (for more),</p><p>I think the difference between this kind of modern design and old pattens is just like the difference between classic and modern physics.</p><p>In classic, you write a function and set a boundary.</p><p>Here, you write a distribution function and give a number of random objects.</p><h2 id=good-art-or-bad>Good art or bad</h2><p><a href=https://ddfblog2012.wordpress.com/2012/12/31/art/>https://ddfblog2012.wordpress.com/2012/12/31/art/</a></p><p>This is just my own opinion.</p><blockquote><p>Art is not what you see but what you make others see.</p></blockquote><p>I was always confused by this question: how to evaluate an art work.</p><p>My own experiences drive me suppose that there might be two types of art critic: Performer View (PV) and Artist View (AV). It is not to say that any work in artist view is better than performer&rsquo;s, but we consider these two types separately.</p><p>For PV,</p><p>So in this view, the judgement of an art work is not only depend on the art itself, but also deeply depend on the observers.</p><p>How the observers feel, how the majority responds.</p><p>To judge an artwork is better or worse than another, a poll is needed. Statistics works here.</p><p>In AV, we set a lot of standards by rules, especially the ways how the author shows his emotions and his insight ideas.</p><p>How he expresses his understanding of the real life or an imagine world in an appealing and concentrated way using some kind of typical or ideal work.</p><p>I think a wonderful art work should send the author&rsquo;s creative or insight informations with following four aspects:</p><p>Simple, essential, exact and beautiful.</p><p>Maybe we can establish a lot of levels of rules to judge works. I don&rsquo;t know what these levels are, but I believe,</p><p>If you want to break a rule in a lower level, you should maintain or improve the higher level rules.</p><p>Moreover, we can understand PV and AV by this analogy.</p><p>PV is like you judge a girl by her physical beauty.</p><p>AV is like you judge a girl as you want her to be your wife, characteristics come first, and appearance is secondary.</p></div><div class=tags></div></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>2026 © Copyright Yingkui.com All Rights Reserved</div></nav></div></body></html>
