The human brain treats deep study and high-risk entrepreneurship as “high-cost” activities because they consume scarce cognitive and emotional resources. Long sessions of formal learning generate cognitive fatigue and “ego depletion,” while high-stakes business moves trigger stress hormones and risk aversion. Without external structures, most people drift toward low-effort, low-risk behaviors.</p><ol start=3><li>The Pain of Formal Learning</li></ol><p>Formal education introduces unfamiliar frameworks and forces confrontation with ignorance, which is inherently uncomfortable. Each step—memorizing vocabulary, solving complex proofs, writing long essays—requires overcoming boredom and uncertainty. This discomfort is not a design flaw but an indicator of neural plasticity: the brain must break old patterns to encode new ones. Yet without deadlines, exams, or credential requirements, very few people voluntarily sustain the struggle to master calculus, history, or foreign languages at a deep level.</p><ol start=4><li>The Pain of Huge Money-Making</li></ol><p>Massive wealth creation also requires counterintuitive discipline. Founders must invest profits instead of spending them, maintain years of unglamorous execution, and make decisions that may only pay off a decade later. The psychological stress mirrors that of extreme training: long hours, high stakes, and constant exposure to criticism. The risk of total failure and social embarrassment discourages most people from even starting.</p><ol start=5><li>Why We Must “Force” Participation</li></ol><p>Because these activities feel painful in the short term, society creates mechanisms of compulsion and incentive:</p><p>Schools and Degrees: Formal credentials, grades, and structured curricula provide external deadlines and social pressure.</p><p>Capital and Contracts: Venture funding, legal obligations, and public markets push entrepreneurs to execute under timelines.</p><p>Cultural Expectations: Family, peers, and media glorify educational achievement or business success to create reputational stakes.</p><p>These mechanisms act like training wheels. They ensure participation long enough for intrinsic motivation and mastery to emerge. Without them, most individuals would not persist through the early, painful stages of learning or entrepreneurship.</p><ol start=6><li>Pain as a Signal, Not a Barrier</li></ol><p>Ironically, the very pain people try to avoid is what produces transformation. Neural growth requires metabolic energy and discomfort; skill acquisition requires repeated failure; large-scale success requires repeated risk. By reframing pain as a necessary cost of transformation rather than a signal to stop, societies can cultivate individuals who push beyond comfort zones.</p><ol start=7><li>Implications for Policy and Personal Growth</li></ol><p>If society wants more deep thinkers and bold entrepreneurs, it must build systems that combine discipline with opportunity. Subsidized education, transparent capital markets, and mentorship networks reduce the unnecessary friction while preserving the necessary challenge. For individuals, understanding that “pain now equals power later” can help rewire motivation and make the external “forcing” feel like self-directed growth.</p><ol start=8><li>Conclusion</li></ol><p>Formal learning and huge money-making feel painful because they fight our evolutionary defaults toward ease and immediacy. Left alone, most people would not spontaneously master deep knowledge or build major enterprises. External pressures—curricula, deadlines, contracts, and social expectations—are therefore not oppressions but scaffolds. They transform short-term discomfort into long-term capability and wealth. The task for modern societies is not to remove the pain entirely but to channel it productively, so that more people can cross the threshold from forced participation to voluntary mastery.</p></div><div class=tags></div></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>2026 © Copyright Yingkui.com All Rights Reserved</div></nav></div></body></html>
