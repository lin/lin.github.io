Emotional regulation is the ability to notice, understand, and manage your emotional responses so they don’t hijack your behavior
Instead of being yanked around by every spike of fear, anger, or shame, you can feel those emotions and still choose your response.
When you feel attacked, your amygdala floods your system with stress hormones. If you can regulate that surge, you create the mental space to listen, consider new evidence, and update your views rather than reflexively refute them."><meta itemprop=wordCount content="201"><meta property="og:url" content="https://yingkui.com/mv/emotions/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Yingkui Lin"><meta property="og:title" content="Yingkui Lin"><meta property="og:description" content="Emotions emotional regulation.

Mindful awareness activates the prefrontal cortex, which can then dampen the amygdala’s fight-or-flight response. Over time, practicing regulation strengthens these neural pathways, making calm reflection your default.</p><p>Investing, entrepreneurship, or any high-stakes choice involves risk and incomplete information. Unregulated fear can cause overcaution; unregulated excitement can cause recklessness. Regulation provides the clarity to weigh evidence and act proportionally.</p><p>During bereavement, job loss, or major life change, regulation helps you process pain without collapsing into paralysis. It’s about letting the waves of emotion pass without drowning, so you can continue functioning and healing.</p></div><div class=tags></div></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>2025 © Copyright Yingkui.com All Rights Reserved</div></nav></div></body></html>
