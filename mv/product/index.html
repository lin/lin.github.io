Products as Faster Paths to Solutions
At their core, products exist to shrink the time and effort between a problem and its solution. Just as learning a new word speeds up your “next word prediction” in conversation or writing, using a well-designed product accelerates your ability to act in the world. A camera, for example, lets memory leap from the fragile and fleeting biological substrate of the brain to a durable and easily retrievable format. A search engine transforms hours of library work into seconds of query time. Both vocabulary and products serve the same function: they encode complexity into accessible, reusable units."><meta itemprop=wordCount content="808"><meta property="og:url" content="https://yingkui.com/mv/product/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Yingkui Lin"><meta property="og:title" content="Yingkui Lin"><meta property="og:description" content="All products are dictionaries Product as Dictionary: Turning Learned Vocabulary into Executable Tools

Just as learning a new word speeds up your “next word prediction” in conversation or writing, using a well-designed product accelerates your ability to act in the world. A camera, for example, lets memory leap from the fragile and fleeting biological substrate of the brain to a durable and easily retrievable format. A search engine transforms hours of library work into seconds of query time. Both vocabulary and products serve the same function: they encode complexity into accessible, reusable units.</p><p>Mining Lexemes from Reality</p><p>Creating a product is essentially a kind of cognitive mining. In language, we compress an entire concept into a single lexeme—a word—so that we can retrieve and recombine it quickly. Similarly, in design and engineering, a product compresses a sequence of actions, tools, and materials into one coherent unit that anyone can use. The real genius of product creation lies in finding a “natural path” through reality, codifying it, and making it executable by others. This process lowers cognitive and pragmatic costs: it reduces the number of decisions users must make, increases reliability, and amplifies gains.</p><p>Think of how navigation apps compress cartography, live traffic, and optimal routing into a simple interface. Behind one tap is an immense hidden infrastructure. The user’s cognitive burden shrinks, and their ability to act grows. This is exactly what a word does in a sentence—it hides a world of meaning behind a compact symbol.</p><p>The Power of Thinking This Way</p><p>When we treat products as “dictionaries” of reality, we shift from seeing them as mere artifacts to seeing them as compressed knowledge. This mindset leads to several advantages:</p><p>Design Efficiency: By focusing on reducing the “search space” for users, we create tools that feel intuitive and powerful.</p><p>Scalable Insight: Each product or feature becomes a lexeme in a larger “language of action,” enabling richer combinations and higher-order problem solving.</p><p>User Empowerment: People gain the ability to act beyond their native skills, just as vocabulary lets them express thoughts they couldn’t otherwise articulate.</p><p>Innovative Lens: Viewing reality as a field of latent lexemes invites systematic discovery. Instead of chasing random ideas, we look for high-leverage compressions—patterns that, once captured, save effort for millions.</p><p>Ultimately, thinking of products this way makes us better builders and learners. It connects the act of invention with the act of understanding language, both of which are about compressing complexity into actionable form. When you see a product as a dictionary entry for a real-world capability, you stop merely making “things” and start expanding the language of human action itself.</p><p>Ideas and Ideologies as Products</p><p>This pattern isn’t limited to physical or digital goods. Ideas themselves can be products. Ideologies, religions, and political platforms function as cognitive “packages” designed to simplify the world and reduce decision-making costs. They offer pre-assembled interpretations of reality, moral codes, and action rules, making complex judgments feel straightforward. In essence, these systems are “mental products” that compete for attention, adoption, and loyalty—just like brands or apps. They are sold, spread, and refined because they promise to compress uncertainty into actionable meaning, giving people a ready-made “dictionary” of how to live, choose, and believe.</p><p>When Products Fake the Gain</p><p>Not all products are designed to genuinely reduce effort or increase capability. Some are engineered to exploit cognitive biases, presenting the illusion of prediction-error reduction while delivering little or no real benefit. Just as cons manipulate trust to exchange fake goods for real money, certain products—whether physical, digital, or ideological—can “cheat” consumers by faking the gain. They exploit marketing, scarcity, or psychological triggers to create a perception of utility that does not exist. Recognizing this risk reminds us that products are not inherently benevolent tools; they are also potential instruments of manipulation, and we must evaluate their true effectiveness rather than their advertised promise.</p><p>Levels of Product Quality</p><p>Building a great product is not a binary “good or bad” question but a progression of levels. At the most basic, a product only needs to be usable—many government-designed systems fall into this category: they technically work but are painful to navigate. A level above that is ease of use, where user experience design smooths out friction so that tasks feel natural and intuitive. Beyond usability lies delight, where products become genuinely enjoyable, applying playful elements or aesthetics—like gamification or the appeal of a Hello Kitty design. Finally, at the highest level, products can become addictive, creating experiences so compelling (as with certain games, songs, or shows) that people go out of their way to keep using them. Understanding these layers helps designers decide what they’re aiming for and warns consumers about how deep their engagement might go.</p></div><div class=tags></div></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>2025 © Copyright Yingkui.com All Rights Reserved</div></nav></div></body></html>
