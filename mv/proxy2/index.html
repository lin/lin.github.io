Ignoring or reinterpreting new evidence is far cheaper in the short term. Your brain prefers low-energy, high-certainty states even if they’re wrong.</p><p>For most of human history, being accepted by your group meant survival; being expelled could mean death. So our brains evolved to value social belonging more than strict accuracy. Defending shared beliefs signaled loyalty, which built trust and cohesion. Even today, our nervous system treats a threat to our group identity almost like a physical danger.</p><p>In Cambodia during the 1970s, the Khmer Rouge claimed to solve the problem of inequality and Western exploitation. But instead of revisiting their methods as evidence of harm emerged, they doubled down on extreme agrarian policies, collectivization, and purges. By falling in love with their ideological “solution,” they lost sight of the human problem they claimed to address—justice and dignity—and inflicted massive suffering.</p><p>In early 20th-century Germany, the problem many citizens perceived was humiliation, loss of status, or vulnerability after World War I (and, before that, fears of encirclement in WWI). People wanted dignity, economic security, and safety. Those are legitimate human problems.</p><p>But the solution offered — militant nationalism, conquest, racial ideology, or “total war” — became emotionally fused with the problem itself. Over time, the idea of “national honor through war” stopped being one option and became the only thing people could imagine. Questioning the war effort or the ideology was treated as questioning the very survival of the nation.</p><p>The solution becomes the identity: wearing the uniform, obeying orders, singing patriotic songs. Losing the solution would feel like losing himself. The problem — security and dignity — is barely discussed anymore, except as slogans.</p><p>Companies that cling to a failing product line because “this is our flagship” instead of asking “what do customers actually need?”</p><p>Religious or ideological groups where preserving the ritual matters more than alleviating suffering.</p><p>Why People Love Solutions More Than Problems</p><p>Solutions are tangible and action-oriented; they feel like progress.</p><p>Problems are abstract and uncomfortable; they require ongoing reflection.</p><p>Solutions become rituals and identities — uniforms, slogans, badges — which are rewarding on their own.</p><p>Social rewards (status, belonging, heroism) are attached to defending the solution, not rethinking the problem.</p><p>Germany, 1930s. A 19-year-old named Karl grows up in a small town battered by unemployment and national humiliation after World War I. His father lost his job, his older brother talks bitterly about reparations and inflation. Karl dreams of stability and dignity — a future where his family is safe and his country respected again. That’s the problem he cares about: security and dignity.</p><p>A new movement sweeps the nation promising rebirth: strong leadership, military revival, a pure national community. Karl joins the youth wing. Suddenly, life feels purposeful. He has a uniform, rituals, and a clear path to being “somebody.” The solution — nationalism, militarism — feels powerful and concrete, unlike the vague, painful problem of national decline.</p><p>As Karl rises in rank, his sense of self fuses with the movement. The uniform and salute become his identity; obedience to the party is how he earns status and a future. The original problem — his family’s dignity — fades into the background. Now the solution itself is the goal. Victory. Expansion. Purity.</p><p>Importantly, the solution gives Karl power:</p><p>He commands younger recruits.</p><p>He’s respected in the town.</p><p>He feels morally superior to those who hesitate.</p><p>War begins. Karl sees villages burned, people deported, his own comrades dying. Food shortages hit his home town. But admitting the solution is wrong would mean losing not only his beliefs but also his status, friends, and future. Instead, he tells himself “these sacrifices are necessary,” “our enemies are worse,” “we must double down.” The party’s solution has become the only lens through which he interprets reality.</p><p>By the end, the war has left Germany in ruins. Karl’s family is poorer than before, his brother is dead, his town bombed. The original problem — security and dignity — is further away than ever. By loving the solution instead of the problem, Karl and millions of others helped destroy the very thing they hoped to protect.</p><p>Background: The Real Problem People Faced</p><p>In the early 1930s, Ukraine was the Soviet Union’s main grain-producing region. Ordinary farmers’ core problems were very basic:</p><p>Having enough food to feed their families</p><p>Keeping a portion of their harvest</p><p>Maintaining some control over their land and work</p><p>This was the problem: survival and basic economic security.</p><p>The Official “Solution”</p><p>The Soviet leadership launched forced collectivization to drive rapid industrialization:</p><p>Merge private farms into large collective farms (kolkhozy)</p><p>State requisition of grain to feed cities and export for foreign currency</p><p>Crack down on “kulaks” (wealthier farmers) as enemies of socialism</p><p>In theory this was a plan to modernize agriculture and make it fairer. In practice, the solution became sacred — a sign of ideological loyalty rather than a flexible policy.</p><p>How “Loving the Solution” Unfolded</p><table><thead><tr><th>Original Problem</th><th>Initial Solution</th><th>Distorted Outcome</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Low yields, rural poverty</td><td>Collectivization to pool resources</td><td>Collectivization becomes compulsory and symbolic of loyalty</td></tr><tr><td>Need for stable food supply</td><td>State requisition of surplus grain</td><td>Grain seized beyond subsistence levels, mass starvation</td></tr><tr><td>Economic modernization</td><td>Export grain to buy equipment</td><td>Export continues even as people starve</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Officials inflated harvest figures, demanded impossible quotas, and seized grain even when no surplus existed. Farmers who resisted were punished as saboteurs.</p><p>From Farmers’ Point of View: Problem Forgotten</p><p>Farmers initially wanted:</p><p>A fair share of their own harvest</p><p>Security from famine</p><p>Some autonomy over their work</p><p>Instead they were forced to:</p><p>Join collective farms and lose autonomy</p><p>Hand over food while their families went hungry</p><p>Stay silent or face arrest</p><p>The solution (collectivization) became so tightly bound to ideology and power that the problem (feeding people) disappeared from policy discussions.</p><p>Power Mechanism</p><p>Party officials gained promotion and status by fulfilling collectivization quotas.</p><p>Supporting the policy became a test of political loyalty.</p><p>The policy itself became a source of identity and moral legitimacy, so abandoning it was almost unthinkable.</p><p>Result and Lesson</p><p>The Holodomor (1932–1933) killed millions of Ukrainians.</p><p>Original problem: ensure food and rural stability.</p><p>Sacralized solution: forced collectivization and grain requisition.</p><p>Outcome: a catastrophic famine.</p><p>This shows how falling in love with a solution can end up betraying the problem itself.</p><p>Key Takeaways</p><p>Loving the problem: keep focusing on the real-world need — “Are people fed?”</p><p>Questioning the solution: policies must remain tools, not symbols of loyalty.</p><p>Feedback matters: without open criticism and data, a harmful solution can run unchecked.</p><p>The Original Problem
Kodak’s business was built on making photography accessible. For decades its mission was essentially “help people capture memories easily and affordably.” That was the problem they solved for customers.</p><p>The Solution They Fell in Love With
Film. Kodak’s entire revenue model revolved around selling film and processing chemicals. Even though Kodak itself invented one of the first digital cameras in 1975, leadership feared digital photography would cannibalize its lucrative film sales.</p><p>How the Solution Became Sacred</p><p>Executives equated “success” with selling film rolls and photo paper, not helping people take better pictures.</p><p>All internal incentives and promotions were tied to film-based profits.</p><p>The company treated digital photography as a threat rather than as the future of memory capture.</p><p>What Happened Next
Consumers shifted to digital cameras and then to smartphones. Other companies embraced digital and gained market share. Kodak clung to its legacy business too long, filed for bankruptcy in 2012, and lost its dominant position.</p><p>Why This Shows “Loving the Solution”</p><p>Kodak forgot the problem (helping people capture memories easily) and instead tried to preserve the solution (film sales).</p><p>The solution became part of Kodak’s identity and power structure: its labs, factories, and workforce were optimized for film.</p><p>Updating its model would have meant rewriting job descriptions, power relationships, and financial structures — a threat to its internal “status quo power.”</p><p>The Lesson
When companies treat their current business model as an end in itself rather than a tool to solve a customer problem, they risk obsolescence. Staying in love with the problem (“how do we help people preserve memories?”) would have led Kodak to double down on digital and likely dominate that market.</p><h3 id=mental-inertia-vs-path-dependence><strong>Mental Inertia vs. Path Dependence</strong></h3><h4 id=1-mental-inertia><strong>1. Mental Inertia</strong></h4><ul><li><p><strong>Definition:</strong> Mental inertia is the tendency of individuals or groups to keep thinking and acting in established ways even when the environment has changed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Core Trait:</strong> It’s a psychological and cognitive phenomenon — a kind of “default autopilot” of the mind.</p></li><li><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><ul><li>A teacher keeps using the same teaching methods despite a shift in student needs.</li><li>A company’s leadership keeps relying on old metrics even though the market is changing.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Why It Exists:</strong> The brain conserves energy. Adopting new thinking patterns is costly, so sticking to old ones feels easier and safer.</p></li></ul><h4 id=2-path-dependence><strong>2. Path Dependence</strong></h4><ul><li><p><strong>Definition:</strong> Path dependence is when past decisions, structures, or investments constrain future choices, even after the original conditions no longer apply.</p></li><li><p><strong>Core Trait:</strong> It’s an external, structural lock-in that shows up in institutions, technology, or networks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><ul><li>The QWERTY keyboard layout: designed for mechanical typewriters but still dominant because it became the standard.</li><li>A company builds an IT system early on and then can’t switch easily because of cost, integration, and inertia.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Why It Exists:</strong> High switching costs, sunk investments, network effects, and institutional habits make change expensive and risky.</p></li></ul><h4 id=3-comparing-the-two><strong>3.

How They Reinforce Each Other</strong></h4><p>Mental inertia makes people underestimate the value of changing systems, while path dependence raises the cost of change — together they create a self-reinforcing loop. The longer you stay in one mindset or system, the harder it becomes to leave.</p><h4 id=5-relevance-to-the-solution-vs-problem-debate><strong>5. Relevance to the “Solution vs. Problem” Debate</strong></h4><p>Both mental inertia and path dependence explain why individuals, companies, or governments can <strong>fall in love with a solution</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Mental inertia</strong> locks their thinking — “this is the way we’ve always done it.”</li><li><strong>Path dependence</strong> locks their resources — “we’ve invested too much to change now.”</li></ul><p>This double lock makes it easy to forget the <strong>original problem</strong> the solution was supposed to solve. In a famine, a war, or a business decline, leaders may keep pouring energy into a failing strategy because their minds and systems are built around it.</p><h4 id=6-the-escape-route><strong>6. The Escape Route</strong></h4><p>To counter these forces:</p><ul><li>Stay problem-focused: ask repeatedly, “What are we actually trying to solve?”</li><li>Treat every solution as provisional, not sacred.</li><li>Allow experimentation and parallel systems to lower the cost of change.</li><li>Invite dissent and critical feedback to break cognitive echo chambers.</li></ul></div><div class=tags></div></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>2026 © Copyright Yingkui.com All Rights Reserved</div></nav></div></body></html>
