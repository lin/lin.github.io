its internal model of the world.</p><p>To do that, it builds latent representations (hidden states) that explain incoming sensations and signals.</p><p>In humans, these latent states are often expressed through concepts and words</p><p>A new lexeme in science/economics (say “inflation”) is not just a word, but a chunked model of patterns in the world:</p><p>Before: the student sees prices rising, wages shifting, government printing money, but all feels disconnected → high surprise, fragmented predictions.</p><p>After: with the lexeme “inflation,” the student compresses these events into one causal, generative explanation → surprise is reduced.</p><p>So a lexeme acts like a low-energy boundary condition (a Markov blanket for meaning).</p><p>Benefits in Terms of FEP</p><p>Lower Prediction Error</p><p>Once you learn “inflation,” your brain can predict price movements, news, policies with less confusion.</p><p>This reduces the free energy associated with interpreting economics signals.</p><p>Improved Generative Model</p><p>A lexeme is like adding a new latent variable into your internal Bayesian model.</p><p>This allows you to simulate and forecast future states more accurately.</p><p>Compression / Efficiency</p><p>Instead of storing 100 separate facts, you now bundle them under one compressed representation.</p><p>This saves cognitive resources, freeing up capacity for higher-level reasoning.</p><p>Action Guidance</p><p>With the concept of “inflation,” you know not to keep cash idle during high inflation.</p><p>Lexemes reduce uncertainty in deciding what action minimizes expected surprise.</p><p>Learning a lexeme is like to write a funciton in your brain, you just call the function “inflation()” → and get a quick, structured response.</p><p>Learning a new lexeme under the Free Energy Principle gives you a compressed, generative model that reduces prediction error, increases efficiency, and helps you act adaptively.</p><p>Latent variable in Bayesian terms = something hidden that explains your observations.</p><p>Lexeme = a compressed representation of such a hidden structure, which you can use to make sense of otherwise messy signals.</p><ol><li>If Learned in School (structured)</li></ol><p>The teacher gives you the lexeme (e.g., “inflation”), a clean definition, and examples.</p><p>This is like someone telling you directly: “here’s the latent variable that explains these observations.”</p><p>It saves you time and reduces trial-and-error learning.</p><p>You get to “install” the latent variable into your model quickly and align with the shared cultural/scientific framework.</p><p>If Not Learned in School (self-discovery)</p><p>You still encounter phenomena: prices rising, wages lagging, currency changes.</p><p>Without the label “inflation,” you struggle to unify them.</p><p>Eventually, you might invent your own internal lexeme, like “money rot” or “price sickness.”</p><p>Functionally, your brain is still searching for a hidden variable that reduces prediction error.</p><p>This is a more expensive route in terms of free energy minimization because:</p><p>You may take longer to notice the pattern.</p><p>Your invented concept may not match society’s shared lexeme, so communication costs rise.</p><p>You risk misgeneralizing (e.g., thinking “price sickness” is caused by merchants’ greed, not by macroeconomic forces).</p><p>Why Lexemes Are So Valuable</p><p>They are cultural priors: pre-compressed latent variables that others have already tested.</p><p>When you adopt them, you shortcut the painful process of discovering them on your own.</p><p>In Bayesian language: you’re inheriting a well-shaped prior distribution that reduces your personal free energy much faster.</p><p>Sometimes if you don’t get the lexeme from school (or other cultural sources), your brain may never actually converge on the right latent variable.</p><p>Why That Happens</p><p>Too much noise: The raw experiences are messy. Without the right compression, you can’t see the hidden structure.</p><p>Local explanations: The brain will “patch” things with folk explanations (e.g., “merchants are greedy” instead of “inflation is happening”).</p><p>Missed abstraction level: Some lexemes live at a very high abstraction (like “entropy” in physics). Without exposure, you may never invent it, because you’d need thousands of observations across domains.</p><p>Free Energy Perspective</p><p>Your generative model never gets upgraded with that latent variable.</p><p>That means your predictions remain noisy, error-prone, and costly.</p><p>You live in a world where surprise keeps accumulating, because you lack the compressed concept that would explain away the variation.</p><p>This is like running an algorithm without the right feature space: you keep overfitting to noise.</p><p>Real-World Examples</p><p>Economics:
Without “inflation” as a lexeme, a person might think “money just randomly loses value” or “shopkeepers are cheating.” They never see the systemic cause.</p><p>Biology:
Without the lexeme “germ theory,” people thought disease came from “bad air” or curses. Many never figured it out without schooling.</p><p>Physics:
Without “energy conservation,” phenomena like motion and heat stay mysterious. A craftsman may work with machines daily but never grasp why perpetual motion machines can’t exist.</p><p>Cultural Transmission as Energy Saver</p><p>That’s why education and culture are energy-saving machines.</p><p>They give you ready-made lexemes (latent variables) that humans couldn’t invent alone in a single lifetime.</p><p>Without them, you risk staying trapped in folk theories, never reaching the right model, no matter how much personal experience you have</p></div><div class=tags></div></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>2025 © Copyright Yingkui.com All Rights Reserved</div></nav></div></body></html>
