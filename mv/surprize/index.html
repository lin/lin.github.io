A rat presses a lever.
Sometimes it gets food (reward).
If the rat gets food when it did not expect it, that’s reward exceeds expectation.
In reinforcement learning, this is the positive reward prediction error (RPE).
Why It Feels Good (Reward Signal)
The unexpected food provides new evidence that the world is better (more rewarding) than predicted.
Dopamine neurons fire to signal this positive surprise.
In FEP terms, this means the brain updates its model to reduce free energy:"><meta itemprop=wordCount content="479"><meta property="og:url" content="https://yingkui.com/mv/surprize/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Yingkui Lin"><meta property="og:title" content="Yingkui Lin"><meta property="og:description" content="Surprize Skinner’s Box Setup
