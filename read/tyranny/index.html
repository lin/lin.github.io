Mechanisms: Uses disinformation, “alternative facts,” and constant appeals to “the will of the people” to delegitimize opposition. Illustrations: Draws on examples from Hungary under Orbán, Turkey under Erdoğan, and post‑2016 U.S. political trends. Chapter 2: Colonizing the Mind Concept of colonization: Describes how regimes “colonize” citizens’ mental space—controlling what people see, hear, and remember. Instruments: Highlights state control of museums, monuments, media outlets, and even social media platforms. Impact: Shows how memory institutions become battlegrounds over whose narratives get preserved or erased. Chapter 3: The Nationalist Project National myth‑making: Examines how invented or exaggerated historical narratives (glorious golden ages, heroic founders) fuel national unity. Us vs. them: Nationalism thrives by casting minorities or foreign “others” as threats, justifying exclusionary policies. Case studies: Looks at Japanese textbook controversies, Russian imperial nostalgia, and Indian Hindu‑nationalist curriculum. Chapter 4: From Supremacism to Fascism Ideological lineage: Traces white supremacist ideas (racial hierarchy, “blood and soil”) as building blocks for full‑blown fascism. Evolution of tactics: Shows how coded language (“law and order,” critiques of “globalists”) masks extremist goals. Contemporary echoes: Connects 1930s Europe to present‑day movements in the U.S., Brazil, and beyond. Chapter 5: Anti‑education Attack on schools: Details efforts to ban books, purge “critical race theory,” and restrict classroom discussion of uncomfortable truths. Undermining expertise: Illustrates how public distrust of teachers and scholars weakens resistance to propaganda. Long‑term stakes: Argues that eroding critical thinking in youth is essential for authoritarian entrenchment. Chapter 6: Classical Education Reappropriation of the classics: Explains how fascists selectively quote Greek and Roman texts to legitimize hierarchy and violence. Curriculum overhaul: Describes the push for “Western Civilisation” courses that omit colonialist crimes and marginalize non‑Western voices. Symbolic power: Shows how statues and classical art become tools to signal ideological dominance. Chapter 7: Reclaiming History Forms of resistance: Profiles grassroots “memory activism”—from community archives to counter‑monuments—that challenge official narratives. Role of educators and journalists: Emphasizes teaching media literacy, supporting independent history projects, and safeguarding archives. Ethical imperative: Asserts that preserving a pluralistic, evidence‑based record of the past is vital to sustaining democracy."><meta itemprop=wordCount content="369"><meta property="og:url" content="https://yingkui.com/read/tyranny/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Yingkui Lin"><meta property="og:title" content="Yingkui Lin"><meta property="og:description" content="Jason Stanley: Erasing History Chapter 1: How to Create an Autocracy Central thesis: Authoritarian leaders first dismantle institutional checks (courts, free press, independent agencies) to seize unchecked power.
