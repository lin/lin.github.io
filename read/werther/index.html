Werther refuses to conceal his inner turmoil: he writes long, candid letters about his overwhelming love and despair, publicly flaunting what polite society would call indecorous.</p></li><li><p><strong>Crossing Class Boundaries</strong>
He feels kinship with the rural poor, preferring simple shepherds’ songs to aristocratic salons—undermining the neat lines drawn between “higher” and “lower” orders.</p></li><li><p><strong>Romantic Ideal over Duty</strong>
Rather than accept Lotte’s engagement to Albert (and respect her family’s arrangement), Werther pursues his love obsessively, placing his personal truth above social/familial bonds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Individual Will against Collective Norms</strong>
In a culture that valued solidarity and rational self-control, Werther’s singular focus on his own feelings and his eventual self-destructive act epitomize stark rebellion against communal expectation.</p></li></ul><hr><p>By flouting these deep-rooted norms—emotional, social, familial, and rational—Werther became both a lightning rod for young readers’ yearnings and a symbol of the coming Romantic age, which would prize subjective experience over external rule.</p></div><div class=tags></div></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div>2025 © Copyright Yingkui.com All Rights Reserved</div></nav></div></body></html>
